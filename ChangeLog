2005-03-18  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

    * Tau.pm: Add placeholder for 200 micron THUMPER

2005-01-03  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

    * WVM/WVM.pm (read_data): Ignore values at the end of the file
      that are from the next UT.

    * WVM/WVM.pm (_seek_to_start): Take into account the possibility
      that the hour read from the last line could be barely > than 0.0

    * CsoFit/CsoFit.pm: Fix confusing typos in synopsis

2000-10-24  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

    * Tau.pm: Add updated ratios for wideband

2000-07-17  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

    * t/airmass.t: Use Test module

    * t/transmission.t: Use Test module

    * t/get_tau.t: Add some extra tests for 450W and use the Test module

2000-03-09  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

    * Tau.pm: Change ratios at 450/850 for wideband filters

    * Tau.pm (airmass): Should have croaked rather than carped.

    * Tau.pm: Automatically calculate the inverse relationships.
      Version number now 1.03.
      (number): Strip spaces before pattern match.

    * Tau.pm: Put the 1350 and 2000 micron relationship into the module.

    * Tau.pm (get_tau): Now use hash %Tau_Relation, which is exported.
      This reduced a lot of the code, and makes it easier to input new
      values for the relations in the future. Also makes it easy for the
      user to determine what relations are being used in the module.

    * Tau.pm: Initial Revision
