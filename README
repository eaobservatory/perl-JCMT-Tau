This is version (1.01) of the JCMT::Tau perl module
---------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION

The code in this module was originally written for the Integration
Time Calculator (ITC) - a CGI script which is currently being used
for estimating the ammount of integration time required to achieve
a desired S/N ratio with SCUBA at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope.
(see http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/jcmt_sw/bin/itc.pl).

The purpose of this module is to store relationships between
zenith sky opacities at 350, 450, 750 and 850 microns with the
opacity at 225 GHz as recorded by the Caltech Submillimeter
Observatory (http://puuoo.caltech.edu/index.html) - CSO Tau. The
relationships have been determined by comparing skydips performed
at the various wavelengths at the JCMT.

It is hoped that as these opacity relationships are determined with
greater precision, this module will continue to be used to store them.
This will be particularly useful in the future at 350 and 750
microns, as at present these wavelengths have very little supporting
skydip data.

INSTALLATION

This is a fairly simple, self-contained module. All that should be
required is the following:

    % perl Build.PL
    % ./Build
    % ./Build test
    % ./Build install
